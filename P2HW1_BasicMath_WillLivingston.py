# Starting the code.

# Enter first number value and assign a name to it.
x = 8
print('x=8') # Displays first number in Shell.
#Enter second number value and assign a name to it.
y = 178
print('y=178') # Displays second number in Shell.
#Add numbers together.
g = x + y # This entry adds both values displayed together.
print('g=x+y') # Both the equation and the answer are being printed and displayed in Shell.
print('g=', g) # This assigns the answer of the addition equation to the name "g".
#Multiply numbers together
v = y * x # This entry multiplies both values together.
print('v=y*x') # Both the equation and the answer are being printed and displayed in Shell.
print('v=', v) # This assigns the answer of the multiplication equation to the name "v".

# End of the code.
